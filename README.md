# POV-Ray-Chessboard

## About
This project was done for a computer graphics modules in 4th year of college. The POV-Ray ray tracing tool was used to construct the scenes. The completed scenes were based required a chessboard and chess pieces. Instead of having only a chessboard and pieces, we deciedd to create a warm setting around the chessboard by modifying the global light source, constructing a table, ashtray and cigar with smoke, keys, glasses, mirror and other surrondings using image maps. 

The completed scene is rendered in 8K . The rendered scene can in each of their respective resolutions can be found within the following file:

- chess_start_8K.png

The code used to compile the scene is stored in chess_start.pov
